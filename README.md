# mt-random
A Java implementation of the Mersenne Twister pseudo random number generator (PRNG).

This code is a resurrected copy of the code I wrote in 2005, with a couple of minor changes.

1. It is now licensed under the more permissive EPL-2.0 license (rather than the LGPL).
2. I have reformatted the code and made a couple of minor updates (none of which should affect the output).
